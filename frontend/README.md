## Install dependencies

### yarn
1. Install `yarn` (see [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
2. Run `yarn install`

## Development server

You can either run the locally installed Angular CLI from `node_modules/.bin` folder, or you install the CLI globally via `yarn global install @angular/cli`.

You can run the server by executing `ng serve`. By default, the webpack server is serving at `localhost:4200`.

Make sure that the proxy configuration (`proxy.conf.json`) is pointing to the correct backend.


## Notes

There is no deployment build available yet.
